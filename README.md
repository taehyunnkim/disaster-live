# Disaster Live, INFO 340
Authors: Eric Kim, Sharon Lin, Jisu Kim, Xi Yan

## Project Description
Disaster Live is a web application designed to inform users of **ongoing world disasters**. We created this project as a source of information for users who currently reside in disaster-struck areas, for those travellers planning ahead or those who are interested in becoming more aware of world disasters.

The Disaster Live webpage contains information on ongoing worldwide disaster, disaster-related news, and global disaster relief organizations. Users may find relevant and current information by using the drop-down menu in the main landing page.
